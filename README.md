# Doodle Jump

This is a doodle jump app created in assembly for University of Toronto Scarborough's CSC B58 Winter 2021.

# Running the Game

Install [MARS MIPS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/) which will allow us to compile and run the assembly code.

Open and run `doodlejump.s`, which has all of the code in one file. Alternatively, you can open the `src` directory and enable the `Assemble all files in directory` setting in MARS and run `src/main.s`, which will use the modularized code.
